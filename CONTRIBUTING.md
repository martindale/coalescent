Contributing
============

Greetings, friends. Please follow these guidelines for contributing code to the
Coalescent project.

Coalescent is intended to be a very minimal framework. As such, almost all new
features should be implemented as middleware/plugins. If you'd like to include
your middleware in this project, awesome, just drop it in the middleware
directory, include tests in the test directory and submit a PR.

If you are fixing a bug, bless you. Be sure to include tests. Active
contributors will happily be added as project collaborators, giving them push
access to this repository.

Style-wise, follow
[Felix's Style Guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide) and use the
JSDoc annotations like you see in the source.

Cheers!
